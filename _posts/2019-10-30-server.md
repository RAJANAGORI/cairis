As announced in a [previous post](https://cairis.org/cairis/cairis2_1/), CAIRIS now supports self-registration and password reset if the CAIRIS server is properly configured.

We've recently created an automated server install process, together with a helper script for nightly rebuilding a CAIRIS server.  You can read more about this [here](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installation-and-configuration-of-server-with-account-registration-via-github-automated).  

If you follow this process, you should be able to quickly -- and without too much pain -- setup your own local CAIRIS server.
