We're in the process of creating a number of video tutorials so, as a home for these videos and other video-based content, we've created a CAIRIS YouTube channel:  http://youtube.com/channel/UC21MvLyGwF9S0f9XlMLBA9Q

We hope you find the tutorials we've made available useful.  Please consider subscribing to keep up-to-date with new videos and other content we make available, and do let us know if you have requests for any specific tutorials.
