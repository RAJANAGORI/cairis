Reserved characters in object names
===================================

When creating most new objects in CAIRIS, you need to provide a name.

The following characters are considered reserved and should be avoided when defining any object name: < > ' ` " \\ : % _ * / ? # Â£ $  
You should also avoid using any non-ASCII characters.

If your object includes these characters, it may be possible for you to add the object, but you may get problems update or deleting them, or exporting model files containing the objects
